# Seven Heaven Website

This is the root project for the first version of my band's website.

The current repository can be found [here](https://www.github.com/lschlierf/sevenheaven-next).

## Live version

This website is hosted through vercel, available at [sevenheaven.band](https://www.sevenheaven.band).

The webiste features seperate mobile and desktop layouts.

## Project structure

This project is comprised of two git submodules, [sevenheaven-site](https://www.github.com/lschlierf/sevenheaven-site) and [sevenheaven-api](https://www.github.com/lschlierf/sevenheaven-api).

In production these run independently, with [vercel.json](vercel.json) tying together the respective paths.

In the dev environment, the backend server also serves a static build of the frontend, along with the contact API.
